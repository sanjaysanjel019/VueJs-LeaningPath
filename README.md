<h1 align="center" style="border: 0;"> VueJS Learning Path </h1>

This is a learning series for VueJs. Here we will be implementing basic VueJS Features to keep improvising and build a credible app later on. I also want to add Tailwind to the project and learn how to use both to build a website.

You can simply look at the each projects since initial projects are done using a VueJS CDN. 

### How the project is organized?
The project has different branches for different features that were updated progressively. Here's the breakdown of project structure.

Project Features | Project Description
------------ | -------------
VueDay1 | Intro to Vue and Data Binding
VueDay2 | Introduction to Events
VueDay3 | Event Handling
VueDay4 | Computed Properties and Lifecycle Methods
VueDay5 | Handling Dynamic CSS with Vue
VueDay6 | Vue Conditionals
VueDay7 | Looping with v-for
VueDay8 | **Punchbag Game** using basic Vue.
VueDay9 |  Intro to Vue Components
VueDay11 |  Vue CLI and Blog Project

Furthermore, there are several branches that have been added progressively. The `master` branch contains project with 11 Folders. All other things added after that are created with a different branch name. After the 11 folders here are the branches to check in order:

- cli-tutorials
- vue-slots
- dynamic-components
- blogVue
- firebase

The end Firebase branch has a running Blog that is able to add and retrieve data from Firebase.
